            <h3>FIFA World Cup</h3>
            <p class="lead">Winning the FIFA World Cup remains one of the pinnacle achievements in any sport.</p>
            <p class="lead">There have been a total of 22 editions of the tournament including Qatar 2022, with this year allowing a chance for Argentina to add a third star after beating France 4-2 on penalty kicks after a wild 3-3 draw.</p>
            <p class="lead">The first edition was held back in 1930 and was won by the hosts, Uruguay. Thirteen teams took part in that tournament and it has since expanded to 32 teams, with the 2026 edition set to be contested by 48 nations</p>
            <p class="lead">For most players, the opportunity to feature in the World Cup is seen as the highest point of their careers, and the competition has often been the stage for some of the most memorable moments in the game's history.</p>
            <p class="lead">Even after Argentina won the 2022 tournament, Brazil are still the most successful nation in World Cup history and have won the famous trophy five times. Germany and Italy are not far behind, having won the competition on four occasions.</p>
